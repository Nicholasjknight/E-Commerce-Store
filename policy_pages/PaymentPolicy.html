            </ul>
        
            <h2>Taxes</h2>
            <p>
                Applicable sales tax will be calculated and displayed during checkout based on your shipping address. Customers are responsible for any additional local taxes or fees that may apply.
            </p>
        
            <h2>Refunds and Chargebacks</h2>

            </p>
            <p>
                If you believe a transaction was unauthorized or incorrect, please contact us immediately. We reserve the right to dispute chargebacks that we determine to be unjustified.
            </p>
        
            <h2>Payment Issues</h2>
